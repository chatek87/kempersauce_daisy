Make sure you installed the DaisyToolchain (i think you already did, should be in program files)
go to
Advanced system settings -> environment variables 
Under "system variables" select "path", click "Edit..."
in the popup, click New and add the following path:
C:\Program Files\DaisyToolchain\bin\
(That should be the default installation location for the toolchain)

in vs code, once you open an example,
go to the microsoft c/c++ extension
head down to "compiler path" and add this path:
C:/Program Files/DaisyToolchain/bin/g++.exe

in the root dir, there's the helper.py file.
cd into myprojects and run python something like this 
"../helper.py create my_pod_project -b pod -l ../"
and it'll set up a new project, all ready to go. 
theres more info in helper.py comments about all the command line arguments


worked for me
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
